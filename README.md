##WebDev Links

[![...](http://f.cl.ly/items/3g2c1i1l1C040Z3F2b24/Image%202013-08-31%20at%204.44.18%20AM.png "...")](http://devlinks.co.uk/)

WebDev Links is an opinionated collection of links related to Productivity, SaaS, Web Development, Full-Stack Development, Tinkering, and Hacking the Open Web.

It is a collection of resources designed to get things done. Think of it as a knowledge transfer, and a product of the Hacker Gift Culture.

I have not fully automated the process by which the corresponding Twitter links are added alongside each link. A script is used to find them, but there is still a lot of copying and pasting, as the script bails out when over 100 links are added. As such:

* The links you see on the main page will _not_ change.
* Only the markdown file will change! [...](https://github.com/dhig/devlinks.co.uk/blob/gh-pages/devlinks.co.uk.md)

This project is [opinionated](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Make_Opinionated_Software.php), and is a reflection of the surfing habits of  [The Maintainer](http://higg.im/).
You can make changes to it, by [forking it](https://github.com/dhig/devlinks.co.uk/fork), but I will not be accepting pull requests.

You can [Download the site's source-code](https://github.com/dhig/devlinks.co.uk/archive/gh-pages.zip), or [file an issue](https://github.com/dhig/devlinks.co.uk/issues) about the site if you have any questions / queries.
